# Abstract
This is a post of DFT framework, I hope to strengthen my understanding of DFT and improve some of the contents of my master's thesis during organizing these contents.

This post will focus on the framework of DFT, and maybe some details. Most of the content will comes from references to other peopleâ€™s work, so a detailed citation will be made.

# DFT

## Defination

Density-functional theory (DFT) is a method for computing the electronic structure of molecules and solids. It is a generalization of quantum chemistry and quantum mechanics.

[Density functional theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory)

Density-functional theory (DFT) is a computational quantum mechanical modelling method used in physics, chemistry and materials science to investigate the electronic structure (or nuclear structure) (principally the ground state) of many-body systems, in particular atoms, molecules, and the condensed phase.
