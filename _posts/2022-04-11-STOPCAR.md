# STOPCAR
During the VASP program execution, we can creat a file names `STOPCAR` to stop the program.
If the `STOPCAR` contains the line:
```bash
LSTOP = .TRUE.
```
then VASP will stop at the next ionic step.

If the `STOPCAR` contains the line:
```bash
LABORT = .TRUE.
```
VASP stops at the next electronic step, i.e. WAVECAR and CHGCAR might contain non converged results.

If possible use the first option.
